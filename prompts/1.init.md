# Cms system
I want you to help me initialize a react tailwind library to create react components to build content for landing pages.

The idea is that we should be able to instantiate components (like heros, menus, carrousels) just with a json configuration object like this

```json
[
  {
    "type": "Hero",
    "title": "Big oppening",
    "background": "bg-gradient-radial from-blue-50 via-blue-50 to-blue-100/50",
    "padding": "lg",
    "subtitle": "Come join us in the most fantastic opening this season",
    "call_to_action": "Join Us"
  },
  {
    "type": "footer",
    "mail": "picante@picanteverde.com"
    "text": "all rights reserved"
  }
]
```

this react component should get a json configuration an a library with components (hero, menu, etc) and intatiate the components from the library with the parameters needed

```ts

<CMSContent
  content={content}
  components={defaultComponentRegistry}
/>
```

the default component registry is just a dictionary with the react components

## componentization

components properties could be string or (when applicable as content) other components like this

```json
[
  {
    "type": "Hero",
    "title": {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Big Oppening",
      "level": "h1",
      "size": "4xl",
      "weight": "black",
    },
    "background": "bg-gradient-radial from-blue-50 via-blue-50 to-blue-100/50",
    "padding": "lg",
    "subtitle": "Come join us in the most fantastic opening this season",
    "call_to_action": "Join Us"
  },
  {
    "type": "footer",
    "mail": "picante@picanteverde.com"
    "text": "all rights reserved"
  }
]
```
